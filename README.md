# Searching and sorting: Final assessment

You are working on a customer management system for a large retail organization. The organization has been collecting customer data for some time and now has data for tens of thousands of customers in an array.

Your task is to write a few helper functions that will facilitate manipulating the customer data.

> *Note: If downloading the assessment files to your local machine, make sure you're running Node v18 before you run* `npm install`.
>
> 1.  *Check which version you are running:* `node -v`
> 2.  *If needed, change the version to v18:* `nvm use v18`
>
> _For additional help, review the "Learn your tools: Visual Studio Code" lesson in the "Welcome" module._

## Instructions

Your goal for this assessment is to get the tests to pass.\
To do so, you will be implementing the algorithms for each of the files listed below.

### The data

The array of customers takes the following form:

```
[
  {
    "username": "Maude.Torp",
    "email": "Taya.Kerluke53@gmail.com",
    "address": {
      "street": "Rowe Fields",
      "suite": "Suite 231",
      "city": "Tiannamouth",
      "zipcode": "07584-6653",
      "geo": { "lat": "75.0283", "lng": "-17.1824" }
    },
    "phone": "795-827-5446 x18366",
    "website": "nico.com",
    "company": {
      "name": "Champlin, Feest and Barrows",
      "catchPhrase": "Object-based user-facing orchestration",
      "bs": "transition integrated content"
    },
    "firstName": "Maida",
    "lastName": "Feeney"
  },
  {
    "username": "Brendan_Lehner",
    "email": "Chelsey.Little@gmail.com",
    "address": {
      "street": "Kuhic Mews",
      "suite": "Suite 469",
      "city": "Chadrickview",
      "zipcode": "60257-0239",
      "geo": { "lat": "75.9918", "lng": "-118.5832" }
    },
    "phone": "1-336-548-0143",
    "website": "olga.com",
    "company": {
      "name": "Treutel, Schmitt and Marvin",
      "catchPhrase": "Open-source exuding algorithm",
      "bs": "envisioneer interactive partnerships"
    },
    "firstName": "Golden",
    "lastName": "Fahey"
  },
  ...
]

```

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment.

#### 1\. Sorting

In order to present the data in a meaningful way, it's necessary to sort the array. Implement a sorting algorithm of your choice. Your sorting function should be named `sort()` and should accept two parameters.

```
function sort(compare, elements) {}

```

Where:

- `compare`: A function that compares two elements, so it takes two parameters: `left` and `right`. It returns one of the following:
  - `0` if the left element is equal to the right element
  - A positive value if the left element is greater than the right element by the ordering criterion
  - A negative value if the left element is less than the right element by the ordering criterion
- `elements`: The array to which the sorting algorithm is applied.

The sorting algorithm must be stable.

#### 2\. Sort by name

The company wants the entire array of customers sorted by last name and first name. That is, the entire array should be sorted by last name. But, if any people share the same last name, then they should be sorted by first name.

For example, Amy Bogan comes before Beatrice Bogan, who comes before Amy Crooks.

Write a function named `nameSort()` that accepts the array of elements to be sorted and returns the array sorted as described. The `nameSort()` function should use the `sort()` function defined in task 1 to accomplish the task. Hint: You may consider calling the `sort()` function twice.

#### 3\. Search by name

Write a function named `searchByName()` that accepts three parameters:

- `firstName`: The first name of a customer
- `lastName`: The last name of a customer
- `customers`: The array of customers, sorted by first and last name

The function should implement a binary search and return the index of the customer with the given first and last names. If no customer with those names is found, then return `-1`.

#### 4\. Search by email

Write a function named `searchByEmail()` that accepts two parameters:

- `email`: The email address to search for
- `customers`: The array of customers sorted by first and last name

The function should return the index of the customer with the given email address. If no customer with that email address is found, return `-1`.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
